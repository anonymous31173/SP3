The package should be considered a supplement to Dr. Michael Lustig's ESPIRiT package, available at http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/Software.html. The main purpose function of the SP3 package is to extend the SPIRiT method to 3D. Here we focus on data acquired with stack of non-Cartesian 2D trajectories.

Setup
First download and setup the ESPIRiT package from the link above, then download SP3. Copy the m-files in @NUFFT to the @NUFFT of ESPIRiT/, and copy the m-file in utils/ to the utils/ in ESPIRiT/. Copy @SPIRiT to ESPIRiT/
